The only library needed is, Dont forget to put in "lib" folder:

-> sqljdbc4.jar

OBS TRY NOT TO USE!
-> jtds-1.3.1.jar (i used this first and it worked at CP but not at WalterHausen on SQL2008 Server,
 i think the Connection string should be different for jtds-1.3.1.jar when connecting to SQL2008)
